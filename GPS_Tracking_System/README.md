### Brief Introduction
When the Rover is on the road, the on-board GPS tracker would report the GPRMC log periodically to a Tracker Server where the log would be processed for inquery. <br> 
We can use JS to query the Tracker Server and visualize the response. 
#### GPS_Tracker_Server.ipynb would setup this Tracker Server.
#### GPS_Tracker_Client.ipynb would simulate the behavior of on-board GPS tracker and report to the Tracker Server. Meanwhile, the response visualization is also shown in it.
