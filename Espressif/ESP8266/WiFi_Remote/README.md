### WiFi2IR_Remote
* Use WiFi development board and Inferred LED to control projector.
* Decode ir signal with the board 
* Setup a http server with the board
* Server receive command then send it to projector.
### Hardware
* Receiver VS1838B
* Inferred LED
* 150Î© resistor
* ESP8266 WiFi SOC
### Decode IR signal from projector remote
* [Here](https://github.com/xg590/IoT/blob/master/Infrared/README.md#use-receiver-vs1838bamazon-to-decode-remote-signal) are the wiring scheme and code. 
* From Arduino serial monitor, we have following result:
``` 
20:25:00.723 -> Protocol=7 Address=0xF483 Command=0x17 Raw=0xE817F483 
```
It means the projector remote use NEC protocol send command 0x17 to address 0xF483. This command tell projector to power off. We can clone the ir signal and use an ir led to control projector
### Send cloned IR signal to projector.
* [Here](https://github.com/xg590/IoT/blob/master/Infrared/README.md#sender) is the wiring scheme 
<img src="wifi_remote.jpg"></img> 
* [wifi_remote.ino](wifi_remote.ino) is the code 
* As the code runs on WiFi Soc, a http server runs on WLAN.
* Use GET method to tell WiFi Soc what command we want it to send.

import requests 
requests.get('http://192.168.0.108/irled?cmd=22&delay=5') # Home 
```
### Command explanation 
After we decoded one ir signal, we know the command is 0x17. It is a hex. How do we send 0x17 over http to the board? We convert the hex (0x17) to decimal (23) before http request, then cast the string "23" back to integer 23 after http.
