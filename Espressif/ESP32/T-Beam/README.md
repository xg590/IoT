* Official GitHub: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-LoRa-Series
* Install libraries: Move all sub-folders in LilyGo-LoRa-Series/libdeps to ~/Arduino/libraries
### Difference between LoRa and LoRaWAN
* LoRa is the Physical Layer protocol that supports Network Layer protocol LoRaWAN.
* LoRa is about RF signal and LoRaWAN addresses MAC/Encryption.
### Two libraries in LilyGo-LoRa-Series examples
* Arduino LoRa is the library for LoRa operations. 
* RadioLib supports LoRa operation but intends to include LoRaWAN functions.
### Play examples
* Must uncomment board version and change LoRa_frequency in [utilities.h](utilities.h) 
``` 
#define LILYGO_TBeam_V1_1 
#define LoRa_frequency      433.0
```
