Captrue images in jpeg format by the on-board PiCamera and send them to a streaming webserver.
The motion jpeg could be rendered in user's browser.
This scheme will minimize the burden on Raspberry Pi Zero W of the Rover. (Around 5% cpu consumption, 10% RAM comsumption at most)
If the capture is at 480p and 1fps then bandwidth comsumption is about 800kbps (of course, equals the size of a jpeg image)
