### Transmitter
* Use WiFi development board and Inferred LED to control a projector. 
* Setup a http server with the board
* Server receive command then send it to projector.
### Hardware 
* Inferred LED
* 150Î© resistor
* ESP8266 WiFi SOC
### Wiring
```
D11 <-150 Oh-> OUT (Longer electrode)
GND <--------> GND (Shorter)
```

### Decoded IR signal from the original projector remote 
* In receiver part of this project, we have following result:
``` 
20:25:00.723 -> Protocol=7 Address=0xF483 Command=0x17 Raw=0xE817F483 
```
* It means the original projector remote use NEC protocol send command 0x17 to address 0xF483. 
* It tells projector to power off. 
* We can clone this ir signal and use an ir led to control projector
### Command explanation 
After we decoded one ir signal, we know the command is 0x17. It is a hex. How do we send 0x17 over http to the board? We convert the hex (0x17) to decimal (23) before http request, then cast the string "23" back to integer 23 after http.

### Send cloned IR signal to projector
```C
#define IR_SEND_PIN 11
#include <IRremote.h>
void setup() {
    IrSender.begin(IR_SEND_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);
}
uint16_t sAddress = 0xF483; // uint16_t sAddress = atoi("62595");
uint8_t sRepeats = 0;
void loop() {
    uint8_t sCommand = 0x28; 
    IrSender.sendNEC(sAddress, sCommand, sRepeats);
    // IrSender.sendNECRaw(0xD728F483, sRepeats); 
    delay(3600*1000);
}
```
### Http Server + Transmitter
* [transmitter.ino](transmitter.ino) is the code 
* As the code runs on WiFi Soc, a http server runs on WLAN.
* Use GET method to tell WiFi Soc what command we want it to send.
```
import requests 
requests.get('http://192.168.0.108/irled?cmd=22&delay=5') # Home 
```
