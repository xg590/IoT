### What is Balance Charging
* Three/Four 3.7v LiPo battery cells join together in series and make one 3S/4S LiPo battery. 
* Balance charging means we are going to charge these 3/4 cells in parallel and use the CC-CV charging method.
* In other words, we use 3/4 cells in series but charge them in parallel.
